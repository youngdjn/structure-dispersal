# Load field trees
# Load field perims

# Load drone trees

# Start with Chips

# Filter both tree sets to comparable heights (field tree height can be < 10)...need to think if a mod to code is necessary given that field goes down to 10...what if drone tree is 10 and field was measured as 9.9 and excluded?

# Make matches by calling command line arg

# Assign species to drone trees based on the matched field tree
# Export as crown polygon
